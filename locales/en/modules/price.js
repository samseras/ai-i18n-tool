      q: "What's the difference between one-off payment, pay monthly, and pay yearly?",
      a: "One-off payment membership: This is a one-time payment membership service with a validity of 30 days. After making the payment, you will enjoy membership benefits for a month. The One-off payment membership does not feature an auto-renewal mechanism; once the service period ends, you will need to manually make another payment if you wish to continue enjoying the membership services.<br />Pay monthly and pay yearly membership: These are subscription services based on an auto-renewal mechanism. Once subscribed, the system automatically deducts the fee from your account at the beginning of each billing cycle (monthly or annually) to ensure uninterrupted membership services. The continuous yearly subscription is more economical compared to the continuous mothly subscription, as it usually offers additional discounts, such as a 20% off discount, which helps you save money in the long run.",
    },
    {
      q: "What are K-coins?",
      a: "K-coin is a virtual currency provided by KreadoAI, which can be used to access various services offered by KreadoAI. After using a service, the corresponding amount of K-coins will be deducted from your account. The K-coin consumption rules vary depending on the service.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can unused K-coins carry over to the next month?",
      a: "Unused K-coins do not automatically carry over to the next billing cycle.：<br />The expiration rules depend on the source of the K-coins：<br />1. K-coins given to new users: 180 K-coins are valid for 30 days from registration. Please use them within this period to avoid expiration: <br />2. K-coins from the membership plan: These reset each billing cycle and cannot be carried over.<br />3. K-coins purchased separately: The validity depends on the amount purchased: <br />  - 300, 600, 900 K-coins: Valid for 30 days from purchase.<br />  - 1200, 1500, 3000, 6000 K-coins: Valid for 60 days from purchase.<br />  - 15000, 30000 K-coins: Valid for 90 days from purchase.<br />Make sure to use your K-coins within the specified period to avoid expiration and potential loss.",
    },
    {
      q: "If I run out of K-coins, how can I get more?",
      a: 'If you have used up all your K-coins, there are two ways to acquire more: 1.  By renewing your membership or by purchasing K-coins directly. Renewing your membership not only provides you with K-coins but also offers additional membership benefits. You can also participate in our <a style="color: #357bf7; cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600" href="/ai/rewards">"Earn K-coins"</a> Activity and receive free rewards. <br />If you choose to purchase K-coins directly, you can do so on the <a style="color: #357bf7; cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600" href="/ai/user/recharge">"K-coin recharge"</a> page. Please note that the option to freely purchase K-coins is available only to members.',
